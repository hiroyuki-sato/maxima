  * Closes LP: #124415
  * debian/control: Add emacs22 as a Depends option.
  * debian/maxima-doc.doc-base.tips:
    - Use .shtml instead of .html to fix a lintian error.
  * debian/maxima-doc.doc-base.plotting:
    - Use .shtml instead of .html to fix a lintian error.
  * debian/maxima-emacs.emacsen-install:
    - Install symlinks for source files rather than copying them.  This
      makes find-function work.
    - Install symlink for *.lisp so that we don't need to add
      /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/maxima to load-path.
  * debian/maxima-emacs.emacsen-startup:
    - Remove use of /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/maxima, since this
      causes load-path shadows and is not needed anymore.
