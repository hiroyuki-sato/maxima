  * Merge from Debian unstable (LP: #480039), remaining changes:
     - debian/maxima-doc.doc-base.plotting:
      + Use .shtml instead of .html to fix lintian errors.
     - debian/maxima-emacs.emacsen-install:
      + Install symlinks for source files rather than copying them.  This
        makes find-function work.
      + Install symlink for *.lisp so that we don't need to add
        /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/maxima to load-path.
    - debian/maxima-emacs.emacsen-startup:
      + Remove use of /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/maxima, since this
        causes load-path shadows and is not needed anymore.
    - Comment out backward-delete-char-untabify in maxima.el.
  * Build against newer version of gcl which does work with 
    kernel.randomize_va_space (LP: #303587).
