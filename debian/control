Description: A fairly complete computer algebra system-- base system
 This system MAXIMA is a COMMON LISP implementation due to William F.
 Schelter, and is based on the original implementation of Macsyma at
 MIT, as distributed by the Department of Energy.  I now have
 permission from DOE to make derivative copies, and in particular to
 distribute it under the GNU public license.
 .
 This package contains the main executables and base system files.

Description: A fairly complete computer algebra system-- source code
 Maxima is a full symbolic computation program.  It is full featured
 doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
 functions, integration, Todd-coxeter, graphing, bigfloats.  It has a
 symbolic debugger source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
 based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.  It is
 quite reliable, and has good garbage collection, and no memory leaks.
 It comes with hundreds of self tests.
 .
 This package contains the lisp source code.
