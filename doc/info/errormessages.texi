@node undefined variable during plotting, loadfile failed to load, part fell off the end, Error messages
@subsection undefined variable (draw or plot)
A function could not be plotted since it still contained a variable maxima
doesn't know the value of.

In order to find out which variable this could be it is sometimes helpful to
temporarily replace the name of the drawing command (@code{draw2d}, @code{plot2d}
or similar) by a random name (for example @code{ddraw2d}) that doesn't coincide
with the name of an existing function to make maxima print out what parameters
the drawing command sees.

@example
(%i1) load("draw")$
(%i2) f(x):=sin(omega*t);
(%o2) f(x) := sin(omega t)
(%i3) draw2d(
        explicit(
          f(x),
          x,1,10
        )
      );
draw2d (explicit): non defined variable
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
(%i4) ddraw2d(
        explicit(
          f(x),
          x,1,10
        )
      );
(%o4) ddraw2d(explicit(sin(omega t), x, 1, 10))

@node loadfile failed to load, Only symbols can be bound, undefined variable during plotting, Error messages
@subsection loadfile: failed to load <filename>
This error message normally indicates that the file exists, but can not be read.
If the file is present and readable there is another possible for this error
message: Maxima can compile packages to native binary files in order to make them
run faster. If after compiling the file something in the system has changed in a
way that makes it incompatible with the binary the binary the file cannot be
loaded any more. Maxima normally puts binary files it creates from its own packages
in a folder named @code{binary} within the folder whose name it is printed after
typing:
@c ===beg===
@c maxima_userdir;
@c ===end===
@example
@group
(%i1) maxima_userdir;
(%o1)                 /home/gunter/.maxima
@end group
@end example
If this directory is missing maxima will recreate it again as soon as it has to
compile a package.

@node Only symbols can be bound, out of memory, loadfile failed to load, Error messages
@subsection Only symbols can be bound
The most probable cause for this error is that there was an attempt to either
use a number or a variable whose numerical value is known as a loop
counter.
@node out of memory, cannot assign to function, Only symbols can be bound, Error messages
@subsection Out of memory
Lisp typically handles several types of memory containing at least one stack
and a heap that contains user objects. To avoid running out of memory several
approaches might be useful:
@itemize @bullet
@item If possible, the best solution normally is to use an algorithm that is
      more memory-efficient.
@item Compiling a function might drastically reduce the amount of memory it
      needs.
@item Arrays of a fixed type might be more memory-efficient than lists.
@item If maxima is run by sbcl sbcl's memory limit might be set to a value
      that is too low to solve the current problem. In this case the
      command-line option @code{--dynamic-space-size <n>} allows to tell
      sbcl to reserve @code{n} megabytes for the heap. It is to note, though,
      that sbcl has to handle several distinct types of memory and therefore
      might be able to only reserve about half of the available physical
      memory. Also note that 32-bit processes might only be able to access
      2GB of physical memory.

@node cannot assign to function, No such list element, out of memory, Error messages
@subsection assignment: cannot assign to <function name>
Maxima supports several assignment operators. When trying to define a function
@code{:=} has to be used.

@node No such list element, Comma is not a prefix operator, cannot assign to function, Error messages
@subsection apply: no such "list" element
One common cause for this error message is that square brackets operator
(@code{[ ]}) was used trying to access a list element that whose element
number was @code{< 1} or @code{> length(list)}.

@node Comma is not a prefix operator, makelist second argument must evaluate to a number, No such list element, Error messages
@subsection incorrect syntax: , is not a prefix operator
This might be caused by a command starting with a comma (@code{,}) or by one comma
being directly followed by another one..

@node makelist second argument must evaluate to a number, Illegal use of delimiter, Comma is not a prefix operator, Error messages
@subsection makelist: second argument must evaluate to a number
@code{makelist} expects the second argument to be the name of the variable whose value is to
be stepped. This time instead of the name of a still-undefined variable maxima has found
something else, possibly a list or the name of a list.

@node Illegal use of delimiter, VTK is not installed ,makelist second argument must evaluate to a number, Error messages
@subsection incorrect syntax: Illegal use of delimiter )
Common reasons for this error appearing are a closing parenthesis without an
opening one or a closing parenthesis directly preceded by a comma.

@node VTK is not installed, , Illegal use of delimiter, Error messages
@subsection VTK is not installed, which is required for Scene

This might either mean that VTK is actually not installed - or cannot be found by
maxima - or that maxima has no write access to the directory whose name is output
if the following maxima command is entered:
@c ===beg===
@c maxima_tempdir;
@c ===end===
@example
@group
(%i1) maxima_tempdir;
(%o1)                     /home/gunter
@end group

* undefined variable during translation::
* replaced x by y::
@end menu
@node undefined variable during translation, replaced x by y, Warning messages, Warning messages
@subsection Encountered undefined variable <x> in translation
A function was compiled but the type of the variable @code{x} was not known.
This means that the compiled command contains additional code that makes it
retain all the flexibility maxima provides in respect to this variable.
If @code{x} isn't meant as a variable name but just a named option to a
command prepending the named option by a single quote (@code{'}) should
resolve this issue.
@node replaced x by y, , undefined variable during translation, Warning messages
@subsection Rat: replaced <x> by <y> = <z>
Floating-point numbers provide a maximum number of digits that is typically high,
but still limited. Good examples that this limitation might be too low
even for harmless-looking examples include 
@uref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson%27s_polynomial, Wilkinson's Polynomial},
The Rump polynomial and the fact that an exact 1/10 cannot be expressed as a binary
floating-point number. 
In places where the floating-point error might add up or hinder terms from
cancelling each other out maxima therefore by default replaces them with exact
fractions.
