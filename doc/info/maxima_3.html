expression to be computed is D(j) this is D(j-i).  This is useful in
BATCH files or for referring to a group of D expressions.  For
example, if SUM is initialized to 0 then FOR I:1 THRU 10 DO

<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>EV</B> <I>(exp, arg1, ..., argn)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX11"></A>
is one of MACSYMA's most powerful and
versatile commands. It evaluates the expression exp in the environment
specified by the argi.  This is done in steps, as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

    (1) First the environment is set up by scanning the argi which may
be as follows:
SIMP causes exp to be simplified regardless of the setting of the
switch SIMP which inhibits simplification if FALSE.
NOEVAL supresses the evaluation phase of EV (see step (4) below).
This is useful in conjunction with the other switches and in causing
exp to be resimplified without being reevaluated.
EXPAND causes expansion.
EXPAND(m,n) causes expansion, setting the values of MAXPOSEX and
MAXNEGEX to m and n respectively.
DETOUT causes any matrix inverses computed in exp to have their
determinant kept outside of the inverse rather than dividing through
each element.
DIFF causes all differentiations indicated in exp to be performed.
DERIVLIST(var1,...,vark) causes only differentiations with respect to
the indicated variables.
FLOAT causes non-integral rational numbers to be converted to floating
point.
NUMER causes some mathematical functions (including exponentiation)
with numerical arguments to be evaluated in floating point.  It causes
variables in exp which have been given numervals to be replaced by
their values.  It also sets the FLOAT switch on.
PRED causes predicates (expressions which evaluate to TRUE or FALSE)
to be evaluated.
EVAL causes an extra post-evaluation of exp to occur. (See step (5)
below.)
E where E is an atom declared to be an EVFLAG causes E to be bound to
TRUE during the evaluation of exp.
V:expression (or alternately V=expression) causes V to be bound to the
value of expression during the evaluation of exp.  Note that if V is a
MACSYMA option, then expression is used for its value during the
evaluation of exp.  If more than one argument to EV is of this type
then the binding is done in parallel.  If V is a non-atomic expression
then a substitution rather than a binding is performed.
E where E, a function name, has been declared to be an EVFUN causes E
to be applied to exp.
Any other function names (e.g.  SUM) cause evaluation of occurrences
of those names in exp as though they were verbs.
In addition a function occurring in exp (say F(args)) may be defined
locally for the purpose of this evaluation of exp by giving
F(args):=body as an argument to EV.
If an atom not mentioned above or a subscripted variable or
subscripted expression was given as an argument, it is evaluated and
if the result is an equation or assignment then the indicated binding
or substitution is performed.  If the result is a list then the
members of the list are treated as if they were additional arguments
given to EV. This permits a list of equations to be given (e.g. [X=1,
Y=A**2] ) or a list of names of equations (e.g.  [E1,E2] where E1 and
E2 are equations) such as that returned by SOLVE.
The argi of EV may be given in any order with the exception of
substitution equations which are handled in sequence, left to right,
and EVFUNS which are composed, e.g. EV(exp,RATSIMP,REALPART) is
handled as REALPART(RATSIMP(exp)).
The SIMP, NUMER, FLOAT, and PRED switches may also be set locally in a
block, or globally at the "top level" in MACSYMA so that they will
remain in effect until being reset.
If exp is in CRE form then EV will return a result in CRE form
provided the NUMER and FLOAT switches are not both TRUE.

<LI>

    (2) During step (1), a list is made of the non-subscripted
variables appearing on the left side of equations in the argi or in
the value of some argi if the value is an equation.  The variables
(both subscripted variables which do not have associated array
functions, and non-subscripted variables) in the expression exp are
replaced by their global values, except for those appearing in this
list.  Usually, exp is just a label or % (as in (C2) below), so this
step simply retrieves the expression named by the label, so that EV
may work on it.

<LI>

    (3) If any substitutions are indicated by the argi, they are
carried out now.

<LI>

    (4) The resulting expression is then re-evaluated (unless one of
the argi was NOEVAL) and simplified according the the argi.  Note that
any function calls in exp will be carried out after the variables in
it are evaluated and that EV(F(X)) thus may behave like F(EV(X)).

<LI>

    (5) If one of the argi was EVAL, steps (3) and (4) are repeated.

<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>KILL</B> <I>(arg1, arg2, ...)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX15"></A>
eliminates its arguments from the MACSYMA
system.  If argi is a variable (including a single array element),
function, or array, the designated item with all of its properties is
removed from core.  If argi=LABELS then all input, intermediate, and
output lines to date (but not other named items) are eliminated. If
argi=CLABELS then only input lines will be eliminated; if argi=ELABELS
then only intermediate E-lines will be eliminated; if argi=DLABELS
only the output lines will be eliminated.  If argi is the name of any
of the other information lists (the elements of the MACSYMA variable
INFOLISTS), then every item in that class (and its properties) is
KILLed and if argi=ALL then every item on every information list
previously defined as well as LABELS is KILLed.  If argi=a number (say
n), then the last n lines (i.e. the lines with the last n line
numbers) are deleted.  If argi is of the form [m,n] then all lines
with numbers between m and n inclusive are killed. Note that
KILL(VALUES) or KILL(variable) will not free the storage occupied
unless the labels which are pointing to the same expressions are also
KILLed.  Thus if a large expression was assigned to X on line C7 one
should do KILL(D7) as well as KILL(X) to release the storage occupied.
KILL(ALLBUT(name1,...,namek) will do a KILL(ALL) except it will not
KILL the names specified.  (Note: namei means a name such as U, V, F,
G, not an infolist such as FUNCTIONS.)
    KILL removes all properties from the given argument thus
KILL(VALUES) will kill all properties associated with every item on
the VALUES list whereas the REMOVE set of functions
(REMVALUE,REMFUNCTION,REMARRAY,REMRULE) remove a specific property.
Also the latter print out a list of names or FALSE if the specific
argument doesn't exist whereas KILL always has value "DONE" even if
the named item doesn't exist.
    Note that killing expressions will not help the problem which
occurs on MC indicated by "NO CORE - FASLOAD" which results when
either too many FASL files have been loaded in or when allocation
level has gotten too high.  In either of these cases, no amount of
killing will cause the size of these spaces to decrease.  Killing
expressions only causes some spaces to get emptied out but not made
smaller.

<DT><U>Variable:</U> <B>NOLABELS</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX20"></A>
 default: [FALSE] - if TRUE then no labels will be bound

<DT><U>Variable:</U> <B>OPTIONSET</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX21"></A>
 default: [FALSE] - if TRUE, MACSYMA will print out a

<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>PLAYBACK</B> <I>(arg)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX22"></A>
"plays back" input and output lines.  If arg=n (a
number) the last n expressions (Ci, Di, and Ei count as 1 each) are
"played-back", while if arg is omitted, all lines are.  If arg=INPUT
then only input lines are played back. If arg=[m,n] then all lines
with numbers from m to n inclusive are played-back.  If m=n then [m]
is sufficient for arg.  Arg=SLOW places PLAYBACK in a slow-mode
similar to DEMO's (as opposed to the "fast" BATCH).  This is useful in
conjunction with SAVE or STRINGOUT when creating a secondary-storage
file in order to pick out useful expressions.  If arg=TIME then the
computation times are displayed as well as the expressions.  If
arg=GCTIME or TOTALTIME, then a complete breakdown of computation
times are displayed, as with SHOWTIME:ALL;.  Arg=STRING strings-out
(see STRING function) all input lines when playing back rather than
displaying them.  If ARG=GRIND "grind" mode can also be turned on (for
processing input lines) (see GRIND).  One may include any number of
options as in PLAYBACK([5,10],20,TIME,SLOW).

One may "quit" to MACSYMA top-level by typing Control-C Control-G;
Control-C gets NIL's interrupt prompt, at which one types either
Control-G or just G.  Typing X at the Interrupt prompt will cause a

<DT><U>Variable:</U> <B>SHOWTIME</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX29"></A>
 default: [FALSE] - if TRUE then the computation time will be
printed automatically with each output expression.  By setting
SHOWTIME:ALL, in addition to the cpu time MACSYMA now also prints out
(when not zero) the amount of time spent in garbage collection (gc) in
the course of a computation.  This time is of course included in the
time printed out as "time=" .  (It should be noted that since the
"time=" time only includes computation time and not any intermediate
display time or time it takes to load in out-of-core files, and since
it is difficult to ascribe "responsibility" for gc's, the gctime
printed will include all gctime incurred in the course of the
computation and hence may in rare cases even be larger than "time=").

During a break one may type TOPLEVEL;.  This will cause
top-level MACSYMA to be entered recursively.  Labels will now be bound
as usual.  Everything will be identical to the previous top-level
state except that the computation which was interrupted is saved.  The
function TOBREAK() will cause the break which was left by typing

one sets TTYINTFUN (default FALSE meaning feature not in use) to a
function of no arguments.  Then whenever (e.g.) ^U (control-U) is
typed, this function is run.  E.g. suppose you have a FOR statement
loop which increments I, and you want an easy way of checking on the
value of I while the FOR statement is running.  You can do:
TTYINTFUN:PRINTI$ PRINTI():=PRINT(I)$ , then whenever you type (e.g.)
^U you get the check you want.
