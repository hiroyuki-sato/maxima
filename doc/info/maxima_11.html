<P>
   Polynomials are stored in maxima either in General Form or as
Cannonical Rational Expressions (CRE) form.  The latter is a standard
form, and is used internally by operations such as factor, ratsimp, and
so on.

</P>
<P>
   Canonical Rational Expressions constitute a kind of representation
which is especially suitable for expanded polynomials and rational
functions (as well as for partially factored polynomials and rational
functions when RATFAC[FALSE] is set to TRUE).  In this CRE form an
ordering of variables (from most to least main) is assumed for each
expression.  Polynomials are represented recursively by a list
consisting of the main variable followed by a series of pairs of
expressions, one for each term of the polynomial.  The first member of
each pair is the exponent of the main variable in that term and the
second member is the coefficient of that term which could be a number or
a polynomial in another variable again represented in this form.  Thus
the principal part of the CRE form of 3*X^2-1 is (X 2 3 0 -1) and that
of 2*X*Y+X-3 is (Y 1 (X 1 2) 0 (X 1 1 0 -3)) assuming Y is the main
variable, and is (X 1 (Y 1 2 0 1) 0 -3) assuming X is the main
variable. "Main"-ness is usually determined by reverse alphabetical
order.  The "variables" of a CRE expression needn't be atomic.  In fact
any subexpression whose main operator is not + - * / or ^ with integer
power will be considered a "variable" of the expression (in CRE form) in
which it occurs.  For example the CRE variables of the expression
X+SIN(X+1)+2*SQRT(X)+1 are X, SQRT(X), and SIN(X+1).  If the user does
not specify an ordering of variables by using the RATVARS function
MACSYMA will choose an alphabetic one.  In general, CRE's represent
rational expressions, that is, ratios of polynomials, where the
numerator and denominator have no common factors, and the denominator is
positive.  The internal form is essentially a pair of polynomials (the
numerator and denominator) preceded by the variable ordering list.  If
an expression to be displayed is in CRE form or if it contains any
subexpressions in CRE form, the symbol /R/ will follow the line label.
See the RAT function for converting an expression to CRE form.  An
extended CRE form is used for the representation of Taylor series.  The
notion of a rational expression is extended so that the exponents of the
variables can be positive or negative rational numbers rather than just
positive integers and the coefficients can themselves be rational
expressions as described above rather than just polynomials.  These are
represented internally by a recursive polynomial form which is similar
to and is a generalization of CRE form, but carries additional
information such as the degree of truncation.  As with CRE form, the
symbol /T/ follows the line label of such expressions.

<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>FACTOR</B> <I>(exp)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX331"></A>
factors the expression exp, containing any number of
variables or functions, into factors irreducible over the integers.
FACTOR(exp, p) factors exp over the field of integers with an element
adjoined whose minimum polynomial is p.
FACTORFLAG[FALSE] if FALSE suppresses the factoring of integer factors
of rational expressions.
DONTFACTOR may be set to a list of variables with respect to which
factoring is not to occur.  (It is initially empty).  Factoring also
will not take place with respect to any variables which are less
important (using the variable ordering assumed for CRE form) than
those on the DONTFACTOR list.
SAVEFACTORS[FALSE] if TRUE causes the factors of an expression which
is a product of factors to be saved by certain functions in order to
speed up later factorizations of expressions containing some of the
same factors.
BERLEFACT[TRUE] if FALSE then the Kronecker factoring algorithm will
be used otherwise the Berlekamp algorithm, which is the default, will
be used.
INTFACLIM[1000] is the largest divisor which will be tried when
factoring a bignum integer.  If set to FALSE (this is the case when
the user calls FACTOR explicitly), or if the integer is a fixnum (i.e.
fits in one machine word), complete factorization of the integer will
be attempted.  The user's setting of INTFACLIM is used for internal
calls to FACTOR. Thus, INTFACLIM may be reset to prevent MACSYMA from
taking an inordinately long time factoring large integers.
NEWFAC[FALSE] may be set to true to use the new factoring routines.

<DD><A NAME="IDX336"></A>
When non-rational expressions are involved, one call
to RATSIMP followed as is usual by non-rational ("general")
simplification may not be sufficient to return a simplified result.
Sometimes, more than one such call may be necessary.  The command
FULLRATSIMP makes this process convenient.  FULLRATSIMP repeatedly
applies RATSIMP followed by non-rational simplification to an
expression until no further change occurs.  For example, consider
For the expression  EXP:   (X^(A/2)+1)^2*(X^(A/2)-1)^2/(X^A-1) .
RATSIMP(EXP); gives (X^(2*A)-2*X^A+1)/(X^A-1) .
FULLRATSIMP(EXP); gives   X^A-1 .  The problem may be seen by looking at 
RAT(EXP); which gives  ((X^(A/2))^4-2*(X^(A/2))^2+1)/(X^A-1) .
FULLRATSIMP(exp,var1,...,varn) takes one or more arguments similar 
to RATSIMP and RAT.

is the same as RATSUBST except that it calls
itself recursively on its result until that result stops changing.
This function is useful when the replacement expression and the
replaced expression have one or more variables in common.
FULLRATSUBST will also accept its arguments in the format of
LRATSUBST.  That is, the first argument may be a single substitution
equation or a list of such equations, while the second argument is the
expression being processed.  There is a demo available by
DEMO("lrats.dem"); .

<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>GCD</B> <I>(p1, p2, var1, ...)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX338"></A>
computes the greatest common divisor of p1 and
p2.  The flag GCD[SPMOD] determines which algorithm is employed.
Setting GCD to EZ, EEZ, SUBRES, RED, or SPMOD selects the EZGCD, New
EEZ GCD, subresultant PRS, reduced, or modular algorithm,
respectively.  If GCD:FALSE then GCD(p1,p2,var) will always return 1
for all var.  Many functions (e.g.  RATSIMP, FACTOR, etc.) cause gcd's
to be taken implicitly.  For homogeneous polynomials it is recommended
that GCD:SUBRES be used.  To take the gcd when an algebraic is
present, e.g. GCD(X^2-2*SQRT(2)*X+2,X-SQRT(2)); , ALGEBRAIC must be
TRUE and GCD must not be EZ.  SUBRES is a new algorithm, and people
who have been using the RED setting should probably change it to
SUBRES.
The GCD flag, default: [SPMOD], if FALSE will also prevent the greatest
common divisor from being taken when expressions are converted to CRE
form.  This will sometimes speed the calculation if gcds are not
required.

<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>RAT</B> <I>(exp, v1, ..., vn)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX352"></A>
converts exp to CRE form by expanding and
combining all terms over a common denominator and cancelling out the
greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator as well as
converting floating point numbers to rational numbers within a
tolerance of RATEPSILON[2.0E-8].  The variables are ordered according
to the v1,...,vn as in RATVARS, if these are specified.  RAT does not
generally simplify functions other than + , - , * , / , and
exponentiation to an integer power whereas RATSIMP does handle these
cases.  Note that atoms (numbers and names) in CRE form are not the
same as they are in the general form.  Thus RAT(X)- X results in
RAT(0) which has a different internal representation than 0.
RATFAC[FALSE] when TRUE invokes a partially factored form for CRE
rational expressions.  During rational operations the expression is
maintained as fully factored as possible without an actual call to the
factor package.  This should always save space and may save some time
in some computations.  The numerator and denominator are still made
relatively prime (e.g.  RAT((X^2 -1)^4/(X+1)^2); yields
(X-1)^4*(X+1)^2), but the factors within each part may not be
relatively prime.
RATPRINT[TRUE] if FALSE suppresses the printout of the message
informing the user of the conversion of floating point numbers to
rational numbers.
KEEPFLOAT[FALSE] if TRUE prevents floating point numbers from being
converted to rational numbers.

(except possibly in a non-rational sense) of the variables in v.  If
no coefficient of this type exists, zero will be returned.  RATCOEF
expands and rationally simplifies its first argument and thus it may
produce answers different from those of COEFF which is purely
syntactic.  Thus RATCOEF((X+1)/Y+X,X) returns (Y+1)/Y whereas COEFF
returns 1.  RATCOEF(exp,v,0), viewing exp as a sum, gives a sum of
those terms which do not contain v.  Therefore if v occurs to any
negative powers, RATCOEF should not be used.  Since exp is rationally
simplified before it is examined, coefficients may not appear quite
the way they were envisioned.

adds to the ring of algebraic integers known to

integer coefficients.  MACSYMA initially knows about %I and all roots
of integers. TELLRAT(X); means substitute 0 for X in rational
functions.  There is a command UNTELLRAT which takes kernels and
removes TELLRAT properties.  When TELLRATing a multivariate
polynomial, e.g. TELLRAT(X^2-Y^2);, there would be an ambiguity as to
whether to substitute Y^2 for X^2 or vice versa.  The system will pick
a particular ordering, but if the user wants to specify which, e.g.
TELLRAT(Y^2=X^2); provides a syntax which says replace Y^2 by X^2.
TELLRAT and UNTELLRAT both can take any number of arguments, and
TELLRAT(); returns a list of the current substitutions.  Note: When
you TELLRAT reducible polynomials, you want to be careful not to
attempt to rationalize a denominator with a zero divisor.  E.g.
TELLRAT(W^3-1)$ ALGEBRAIC:TRUE$ RAT(1/(W^2-W)); will give "quotient by
zero".  This error can be avoided by setting RATALGDENOM:FALSE$.
ALGEBRAIC[FALSE] must be set to TRUE in order for the simplification of
