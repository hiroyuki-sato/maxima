  * Rebuild for unmet dependencies
  * ghostview -> gv
  * maxima recommends gv
  * Add plotting and tips doc-base docs from home website pages.
  * Bug fix: "expensive X/tk dependence: request for package split",
    thanks to Sam Halliday (Closes: #291090).  Remove tk dependence from
    maxima package, as gnuplot is default plotting command now.
  * Bug fix: "maxima: Mike Clarkson's version of the manual is superiour",
    thanks to Karl M. Hegbloom (Closes: #196585).  This is not
    redistributable, so a link to an appropriate page has been added into
    README.Debian instead.
